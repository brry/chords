  <title>Away in a manger</title>
  <lyrics> 1. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
 the little Lord Jesus, laid down his sweet head.
 The stars in the bright sky, looked down where he lay:
 the little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.
 _
 2. The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes;
 But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
 I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky,
 and stay by my bedside, 'til morning is nigh.
 _
 3. Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay,
 close by me forever, and love me I pray.
 Bless all the dear children, in thy tender care,
 and fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.

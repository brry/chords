  <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, set your rule and reign in our hearts again. 
 Increase in us, we pray; unveil why we're made.
 Come, set our hearts ablaze with hope like wildfire in our very souls. 
 Holy spirit come invade us now.
 We are your church, we need your power in us.

[V2]
 We seek your kingdom first, we hunger and we thirst. 
 Refuse to waste our lives, for you're our joy and prize.
 To see the captive hearts released, the hurt, the sick, the poor at peace, 
 we lay down our lives for heaven's cause.
 We are your church, we pray: revive this earth.

[C]
 Build your kingdom here, let the darkness fear. 
 Show your mighty hand, heal our streets and land.
 Set your church on fire, win this nation back. 
 Change the atmosphere, build your kingdom here, we pray.

[V3]
 Unleash your kingdoms power reaching the near and far. 
 No force of hell can stop your beauty changing hearts.
 You made us for much more than this, awake the kingdom seed in us. 
 Fill us with the strength and love of Christ.
 We are your church, we are the hope on earth.

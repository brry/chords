  <title>This is amazing grace</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
 Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
 The king of glory, the king above all kings.
 _
 Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
 and leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
 The king of glory, the king above all kings.

[C]
 This is amazing grace, this is unfailing love,
 that you would take my place, that you would bear my cross.
 You laid down your life, that I would be set free.
 Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
 _
 _
 Worthy is the lamb who was slain.
 Worthy is the king who conquered the grave.

[V2]
 Who brings our chaos back into order?
 Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
 The king of glory, the king of glory.
 _
 Who rules the nations with truth and justice,
 shines like the sun in all of its brilliance?
 The king of glory, the king above all kings.

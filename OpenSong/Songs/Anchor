[V1]
 I have this hope as an anchor for my soul.
 Through every storm I will hold to you.
 With endless love all my fear is swept away.
 In everything I will trust in you.
 _
[C]
 There is hope in the promise of the cross.
 You gave everything to save the world you love.
 And this hope is an anchor for my soul.
 Our God will stand, unshakeable.
 _
[V2]
 Unchanging one, you who was and is to come.
 Your promise sure, you will not let go.
 _
 Your name is higher, your name is greater.
 All my hope is in you.
 Your word unfailing, your promise unshaken.
 All my hope is in you.

  <title>Hark the herald angels</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Hark the herald angels sing: "Glory to the new born King.
 Peace on earth and mercy mild, God an sinners reconciled."
 Joyful all ye nations rise. Join the triumph of the skies
 With angelic host proclaim: "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
 Hark the herald angels sing "Glory to the new born King."
[V2]
 Christ, by highest heaven adored; Christ the everlasting Lord;
 Late in time behold him come, offspring of the favored one.
 Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see; hail the incarnate deity.
 Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel.
 Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born King."
[V3]
 Hail! the heaven-born prince of peace, hail the son of righteousness.
 Light and life to all he brings, risen with healing in his wings.
 Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die,
 born to raise the sons of earth, born to five them second birth.
 Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born King."
[V4]
 Come, desire of nations come, fix in us thy humble home;
 Rise, the woman's conquering seed, bruise in us the serpent's head.
 Now display thy saving power, ruined nature now restore;
 Now in mystic union join thine to ours, and ours to thine.
 Hark the herald angels sing, "Glory to the new born King."

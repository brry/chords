  <lyrics>[V1]
 1. In the quiet, in the stillness, I know that you are God.
 In the secret of your presence, I know there I am restored.
 When you call I won't refuse, each new day again I'll choose.
 _
 _
 There is no one else for me, none but Jesus.
 Crucified to set me free, now I live to bring him praise.

[V2]
 2. In the chaos, in confusion, I know you're sovereign still.
 In the moment of my weakness, you give me grace to do your will.
 When you call I won't delay, this, my song, through all my days.
 _
 _
 There is no one else for me, none but Jesus.
 Crucified to set me free, now I live to bring him praise.
 _
 All my delight is in you, Lord, all of my hope, all of my strength.
 All my delight is in you, Lord, forevermore.

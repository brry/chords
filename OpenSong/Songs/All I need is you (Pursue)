  <lyrics>[V1]
 I close my eyes to see my king in majesty.
 Your grace compels my soul to love and drawing close.
 I lift my hands and sing, surrender everything.
 In you I know I'm found. My God, to you I'll bow.

[C]
 Now until forever, Jesus, I surrender.
 Show me what I don't know, more of you.
 I'm desperate for your presence, longing to be with you.
 Lead me to a new place. More of you.

[V2]
 Through the fire I'll persevere. I won't submit to any fear.
 Where I'll go you've been before. All my trust is in you, Lord.

[B]
 Lead me to you. Forever, Lord, I will pursue, I will pursue.
 You've won my heart. Jesus, you're all that I want, all that I want.
 _
 Open my eyes, let me see more of your love, more of your love.
 Here I will wait, just for a glimpse of you, God.
 I'll wait for you, God.

[V1]
 Oh, I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like. 
 But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night. 
 And you tell me that you're pleased and that I'm never alone.

[C]
 You're a good, good father, it's who you are, 
 it's who you are, it's who you are. 
 And I'm loved by you, it's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am.

[V2]
 Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers far and wide. 
 But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide 
 'cause you know just what we need before we say a word.

[B]
 You are perfect in all of your ways, you are perfect in all of your ways, 
 you are perfect in all of your ways to us.

[V3]
 Oh, this love so undeniable. I, I can hardly speak. 
 Peace so unexplainable. I, I can hardly think as you call me deeper still, 
 as you call me deeper still, as you call me deeper still into love, love, love.

  <title>How He Loves Us</title>
  <lyrics>[V]
 He is jealous for me
 Love's like a hurricane, and I am a tree
 Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy
 When all of a sudden,
 I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
 And I realize just how beautiful you are and how great your affections are for me.

[C]
 And oh, how he loves us.
 Oh how he loves us, how he loves us, oh.

[B]
 We are his portion and he is our prize,
 drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes.
 If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking,
 so heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss
 and my heart turns violently inside of my chest.
 I don't have time to maintain these regrets
 when I think about the way.

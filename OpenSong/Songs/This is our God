  <lyrics>[V1]
 1. Your grace is enough, more than I need. At your word I will believe. 
 I wait for you, draw near again. Let your spirit make me new.
 _
 And I will fall at your feet, I will fall at your feet and I will worship you here.
 _
 2. Your presence in me, Jesus light the way, by the power of your word. 
 I am restored, I am redeemed. By your spirit I am free. 
 _
 Freely you gave it all for us, surrendered your life upon that cross. 
 Great is the love poured out for all, this is our God. 
 Lifted on high, from death to life. Forever our God is glorified. 
 Servant and king, rescued the world, this is our God.

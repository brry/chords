  <lyrics> Here's my heart, Lord. Here's my heart, Lord. Here's my heart, Lord.
 Speak what is true. Speak what is true.
 _
 Cause I am found, I am yours, I am loved, I'm made pure, 
 I have life, I can breathe, I am healed, I am free.
 Cause you are strong, you are sure, you are life, you endure, 
 You are good, always true, you are light breaking through.
 _
 Here's my life, Lord. Here's my life, Lord. Here's my life, Lord.
 Speak what is true. Speak what is true.
 _
 You are more than enough, you are here, you are love, you are hope, 
 you are grace, you're all I have, you're everything.

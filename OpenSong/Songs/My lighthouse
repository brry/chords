  <lyrics>[V1]
 1. In my wrestling and in my doubts, in my failures, you won't walk out. 
 Your great love will lead me through.
 You are the peace in my troubled sea. (2x)
 _
 _
 2. In the silence you won't let go, in the questions your truth will hold. 
 Your great love will lead me through. 
 You are the peace in my troubled sea. (2x)

[C]
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse, shining in the darkness, 
 I will follow you. My lighthouse, my lighthouse, 
 I will trust the promise, you will carry me safe to shore, 
 safe to shore, safe to shore, safe to shore.

[V3]
 3. I won't fear what tomorrow brings, with each morning I'll rise and sing. 
 My God's love will lead me through.
 You are the peace in my troubled sea. (2x)
 _
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse, shining in the darkness, 
 I will follow you. My lighthouse, my lighthouse, 
 I will trust the promise, you will carry me safe to shore, 
 safe to shore, safe to shore, safe to shore.
 _
 Fire before us, you're the brightest, you will lead us through the storms.

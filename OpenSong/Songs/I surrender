[V1]
 Here I am, down on my knees again, 
 surrendering all, surrendering all.
 Find me here, Lord as you draw me near, 
 desperate for you, desperate for you.
 _
 I surrender.

[V2]
 Drench my soul, as mercy and grace unfold, 
 I hunger and thirst, I hunger and thirst
 With arms stretched wide, I know you hear my cry, 
 speak to me now, speak to me now.
 _
 I surrender, I surrender, 
 I wanna know you more, I wanna know you more.

[V3]
 Like a rushing wind, Jesus breathe within. 
 Lord have your way, Lord have your way in me.
 Like a mighty storm, stir within my soul. 
 Lord have your way, Lord have your way in me.
 _
 I surrender, I surrender, 
 I wanna know you more, I wanna know you more.</lyrics>

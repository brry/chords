  <lyrics>[V1]
 Take this fainted heart. Take these tainted hands.
 Wash me in your love. Come like grace again.
 _
 Even when my strength is lost, I'll praise you.
 Even when I have no song, I'll praise you.
 Even when it's hard to find the words:
 Louder then I'll sing your praise.
 _
 I will only sing your praise.

[V2]
 Take this mountain weight. Take these ocean tears.
 Hold me through the trial. Come like hope again.
 _
 Even when the fight seems lost, I'll praise you.
 Even when it hurts like hell, I'll praise you.
 Even when it makes no sense to sing:
 Louder then I'll sing your praise.
 _
 I will only sing your praise.

[C]
 And my heart burns only for you, you are all, you are all I want.
 And my soul waits only for you, and I will sing till the morning has come.
 _
 Lord my heart burns only for you, you are all, you are all I want.
 And my soul waits only for you, and I will sing till the miracle comes.
 _
 I will only sing your praise.

[V3]
 Even when the morning comes, I'll praise you.
 Even when the fight is won, I'll praise you.
 Even when my time on earth is done:
 Louder then I'll sing your praise.
 _
 I will only sing your praise.

  <title>Good Grace</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 People, come together, strange as neighbours, our blood is one.
 Children, of generations, of every nation, of kingdom come.

[C]
 Don't let your heart be trouble; Hold your head up high. Don't fear no evil;
 Fix your eyes on this one truth: God is madly in love with you. 
 Take courage, hold on, be strong, remember where our help comes from.

[V2]
 Jesus, our redemption. Our salvation is in his blood.
 Jesus, light of heaven, friend forever. His kingdom come.

[B]
 Swing wide all you heavens, let the praise go up as the walls come down.
 All creation, everything with breath, repeat the sound.
 All his children, clean hands, pure hearts, good grace, good God. His name is Jesus.

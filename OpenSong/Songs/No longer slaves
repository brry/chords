  <lyrics>[V1]
 You unravel me with a melody. 
 You surround me with a song of deliverance from my enemies,
 'til all my fears are gone.
 _
 I'm no longer a slave to fear, I am a child of God.

[V2]
 From my mother's womb you have chosen me. Love has called my name. 
 I've been born again into your family. Your blood flows through my veins.
 _
 I am surrounded by the arms of the father. 
 I am surrounded by songs of deliverance.
 We've been liberated from our bondage. 
 We're the sons and the daughters. 
 Let us sing our freedom. Ohohoh.
 _
 You split the sea so I could walk right through it. 
 You drowned my fears in perfect love.
 You rescued me so I could stand and sing: I am a child of God.

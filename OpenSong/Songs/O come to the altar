  <lyrics>[V1]
 Are you hurting and broken within, 
 overwhelmed by the weight of the sin? 
 Jesus is calling.
 Have you come to the end of yourself, 
 do you thirst for a drink from the well? 
 Jesus is calling.
 _
 O come to the altar, the father's arms are open wide,
 forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

[V2]
 Leave behind your regrets and mistakes. 
 Come today, there's no reason to wait. 
 Jesus is calling.
 Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy. 
 From the ashes a new life is born. 
 Jesus is calling.

[C]
 Oh what a savior, isn't he wonderful? 
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen. 
 Bow down before him, for he is Lord of all.
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen.
 _
 Bear your cross as you wait for the crown, 
 tell the world of the treasure you found.

  <lyrics>[V1]
 The savior alone carried the cross 
 for all of my debts, he paid the cost. 
 Salvation complete, now forever I'm free. 
 Calvary covers it all. 

[C]
 Calvary covers it all. 
 My sin and shame don't count anymore.
 All praise to the one who has ransomed my soul. 
 Calvary covers it all.

[V2]
 No power on earth, not even the grave, 
 could separate us from mercy and grace. 
 He is faithful to save, oh his blood never fails. 
 Calvary covers it all.

[B]
 No one but Jesus can make us pure as snow. 
 We stand in your freedom. Calvary covers it all.

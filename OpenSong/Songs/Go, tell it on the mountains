  <lyrics>[P1]
 Go, tell it on the mountains, over the hills and everywhere.
 Go, tell it on the mountains, that Jesus Christ is born. 
 _
 _
 1. While shepherds kept their watching, o'er silent flocks by night, 
 behold throughout the heavens, there shone a holy light.
 _
 2. The shepherds feared and trembled, when low! above the earth,
 rang out the angel chorus, that hailed our saviour's birth.
 _
 3. Down in a lowly manger, our humble Christ was born;
 And God sent us salvation, that blessed christmas morn'.

[P2]
 Go, tell it on the mountains, over the hills and everywhere.
 Go, tell it on the mountains, that Jesus Christ is born. 
 _
 _ 
 4. When I was a seeker, I sought both night and day.
 I sought the Lord to help me, and he showed me the way. 
 _
 5. He made me a watchman, upon the city wall, 
 And if I am a christian, I am the least of all.

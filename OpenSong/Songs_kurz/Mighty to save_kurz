  <lyrics>[V1]
 Ev'ryone needs compassion, love that's never failing. Let mercy fall on me.
 Ev'ryone needs forgiveness, the kindness of a savior. The hope of nations.

[C]
 Saviour, he can move the mountains.
 My God is mighty to save, he is mighty to save.
 Forever, author of salvation, he rose and conquered the grave,
 Jesus conquered the grave!

[V2]
 So take me as you find me, all my fears and failures. Fill my life again.
 I give my life to follow, ev'rything I believe in. Now I surrender.

[B]
 Shine your light and let the whole world see:
 we're singing for the glory of the risen king: Jesus!

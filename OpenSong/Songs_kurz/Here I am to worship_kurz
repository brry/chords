  <title>Here I am to worship - Licht dieser Welt</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness,
 opened my eyes, let me see
 beauty that made this heart adore you,
 hope of a life spent with you.

[C]
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down.
 Here I am to say that you're my God.
 You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
 altogether wonderful to me.

[V2]
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted,
 glorious in heaven above.
 Humbly you came to the earth you created,
 all for love's sake became poor.

[B]
 I'll never know how much it cost,
 to see my sin upon that cross.
 I'll never know how much it cost,
 to see my sin upon that cross.
